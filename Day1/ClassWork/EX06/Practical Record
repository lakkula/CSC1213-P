Practical no: 06
Problem specification: Do the addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and modulas for 2 numbers

Implementation: 
class EX06{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int num1 = 55;
		int num2 = 20;
		
		System.out.println("Addition is " + (num1+num2));
		System.out.println("Substraction is " + (num1-num2));
		System.out.println("Multiplication is " + (num1*num2));
		System.out.println("Division is " + ((double)num1/(double)num2));
		System.out.println("Mode is " + (num1%num2));
	}
}
Output:
Addition is 75
Substraction is 35
Multiplication is 1100
Division is 2.75
Mode is 15

Conclution: +, -, *, /, % are arithmatic operators
